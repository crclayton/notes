Introduction to Macroeconomics</A>
</H1>

<P>
Macroeconomics studies the averages and aggregates of individual markets to look at the economy as a whole. It deals with short-run behaviour like output, employment, and inflation, and how government policy can effect these variables and steer the economy. It also deals with long-run behaviour, like economic growth, investment, and technological changes. 

<P>
According to Professor Gateman, any half-decent newspaper is going to be about 50% macroeconomics. Furthermore, if you don't understand macroeconomics, you're uneducated and he asks that you do not vote.

The measure of a nation's overall level of economic activity is the value of its total production of goods and services, ie. national income/output. Production of goods and services generates income, such that <SPAN  CLASS="textit">by definition</SPAN> national product = national income. 

<P>
Nominal national income is defined in current dollars, but real national income is measured in constant base-period terms. Prices are held constant when computing real national income, so changes only reflect changes in quantities, not inflation. <!-- MATH

Since 1965, real GDP has persistently trended upward, reflecting long-term economic growth. However, in the short turn there are fluctuations around this trend, called the business cycle. Typically the business cycle is a steep rise increase in output, followed by a period of slow growth or even falling growth. 

<P>
So nation output/national income, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, is what the economy actually produces. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Potential output</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, is what the economy would produce if all resources (land, labour, capital) were fully employed. The difference between these, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> is the difference between the two.

<P>
When <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, the economy is producing more than its potential output. Typically this means that the economy is producing at unsustainable rates. It is called an <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">inflationary gap</SPAN>, because this scenario pushes prices up. When <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, the economy is producing less than its potential. This is called a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">recessionary gap</SPAN>.

Unemployment, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN></A>
</H3>

<P>
To increase nation income, more must be produced, so either more workers must be employed or existing employees must become more productive. In the short run, changes in productivity are very small, so increasing production closely relates to increasing employment. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Unemployment</SPAN> refers to the number of adult workers who are not employed but who are actively searching for a job. If you've never thought about the word employment, take a moment to consider it. It shows that that person is a resource, and as a resource they are a resource being used, or employed by the economy. Similarly, unemployment means that there are resources not being used, namely people. 

<P>
There are different kinds of unemployment. 

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Frictional unemployment</SPAN> refers to constant turnover in the economy of working people. Some people quit to look for jobs elsewhere, some people are fired for showing up late, and some people just graduated and are still looking for a job. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Structural unemployment</SPAN> refers to when there is a mismatch between the available jobs and the available labour force. For instance, all the teaching jobs may be in Alberta, but all the teachers are in BC. Or maybe there is need for lots of millwrights, but there aren't enough millwrights available.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cyclical employment</SPAN> refers to routine unemployment that changes with the ups and downs of the business cycle or unemployment that changes seasonally. For instance, ski instructors don't work in the summer and treeplanters don't work in the winter. Most employment data actually adjusts for these trends, called seasonal adjustments.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
From an economic perspective, the reason unemployment is so important is because human labour is the least durable commodity. If the economy having a slow year so instead of logging 10k trees, only 5k trees are logged. Then you can still log those remaining 5k trees the following year. However, if there are 100 people who are unemployed one year, the value of the labour of 100 people is lost forever. In this way, unemployment is extremely wasteful. 

<P>

Productivity</A>
</H3>

<P>
Long run growth is the result of rising employment (typically a consequence of rising population), rising stock of capital, and rising productivity. 

<P>
Generally speaking, productivity is the amount of output produced per unity of input. Typically <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">labour productivity</SPAN> is measured, as the GDP per person employed or GDP per hour worked. The second measure is typically more accurate, because the first fluctuates with the business cycle and has gradually decreased as people choose to work less hours per year. 

<P>
Productivity is the single largest cause of rising material living standards over time, and has increased drastically in the last few decades. The higher productivity of today's workers explains why real wages (the purchasing power of a worker's earnings) are significantly higher than in the past.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00041400000000000000">
Inflation, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN></A>
</H3>

<P>
Inflation means the prices of goods are services are going up <SPAN  CLASS="textit">on average</SPAN>. If the price of apples are going up, that's not inflation. For it to be inflation, the price of everything has to be going up. The inflation rate is the rate of change of the price level. The  price level, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, is often measured as the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CPI</SPAN> (Consumer Price Index), which serves as an index of the average price of the goods and services that are bought by typical households. As in index, it has no units and is only useful when compared to other periods.

We value money not for the money itself, but rather for the purchasing power of the money - its real value. Inflation reduces the real value of money.

Interest Rates, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN></A>
</H3>

<P>
Interest is the cost of borrowing money. The interest rate is the price paid per dollar borrowed per period of time. It is related to the opportunity cost that the bank is giving up by not investing the money elsewhere and the risk. A bank will lend money to an industrial customer at a lower rate than individuals because there is lower risk of the business defaulting on the loan. 

<P>
"The" interest rate, that economists talk about, is the mean of all interest rates in the economy. The prime interest rate is the rate that banks charge their best customers. The bank rate, is the interest rate that the central bank charges commercial banks. 

<P>
The nominal interest rate is the price paid per dollar borrowed per period of time. However, this doesn't take into account the inflation rate. Let's say you borrow $100 at a nominal interest rate of 10%. If the inflation rate for that year is high, say 15%, when you pay back the $110, even with the extra $10, the amount repaid is worth less than when it was borrowed. 

<P>
The real interest rate takes inflation into account:

The exchange rate is the amount of domestic currency required to purchase one unit of foreign currency. It can be thought of as the price of foreign currency, for instance 1 Euro = 1.43 CAD and 1 peso = 0.07 CAD.

In the context of exchange rates, depreciation means that it takes more domestic currency to purchase foreign currency - rise in the exchange rate. Conversely, appreciation means that it takes less domestic currency to purchase foreign currency - decrease in the exchange rate.

To determine the total value of a nation's output, you can't just add up the market values the output of every firm. This is because some outputs for firms are inputs for other firms, these are called intermediate goods, and we can't double count them.

For instance, say a farmer sells a pound of flour to a baker for $10, and then the baker produces five loaves of bread and sells them all for a total of $15.

<P>
Let's say a Canadian company spends $10 million to construct a factory. This would increase national income by $10 million, but on top of that, the increase in national income would cause an increase in desired consumption because suddenly the carpenters and factories workers have a little bit extra money. So they each buy a TV for their bedroom, so then the TV producers increase production to meet this demand, and so on. 

<P>
For the increased expenditure, there is larger amount of national income generated. This is dependent on the marginal propensity to spend, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, where the higher the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, the more significant the multiplier.

Now having included government and trade, the marginal propensity to spend is not simply equal to the marginal propensity to consume.

This is because 1) due to taxation, disposable income does not increase in equal measures as income, so consumption does not increase as much; and 2) because an increase in income results in an increase in imports, not all expenditure goes into the circular flow diagram, some goes into other countries.

When <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, there is pressure for factor prices to rise because when producing beyond capacity, inputs are in strong demand. This includes labour, so there will be labour shortages and so wages will rise.

A high growth rate however makes poverty alleviation and income redistribution easier politically. Without a growing economy, redistribution of income requires taking from someone and giving to someone else, which is politically sensitive and also effectively reduces someone's living standards. However, with economic growth, income can be redistributed without reducing someone's living standards, rather when there is growth, everyone's incomes can rise but it can be disproportionally allocated to lower-earners.

Coins eliminated this need by creating fixed units, however this needed an authority to guarantee the value. So monarchs would stamp the coin with their seal and the coin would then be accepted at "face value".

Credit is the lifeblood of the modern economy. For instance, wages for workers and production materials have to be paid well before the revenue for a new product is earned.

Consider someone takes $1000 cash out from under their bed and deposits it in the bank, and assume the reserve ratio (RR) is 20%.  The bank would then lend out $800 to the world. Then these people would go out and buy $800 worth of stuff, so the $800 would end up in someone's bank account. At which point, this other bank would lend out  $800(80%) = $640, which would then be spent and so on and so forth.

The increase in the price of bonds causes a decrease in the interest rate.

On top of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> increasing, we also get <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> increasing.

<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Absolute advantage</SPAN> - A country has an absolute advantage when it takes fewer resources to produce a unit of a good than it does for another good. Essentially, absolute advantage amounts to cheaper or more efficient production.

<P>
The gains from specialization and trade are based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. So even if one country is more efficient at producing both good <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> and good <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, it should still trade. Observe the following tables to see why.

So we can see the USA is more efficient at both the production of guns and butter. It takes one unit of input to produce 10 guns, and one unit of input to produce 60 sticks of butter. In comparison, Canada can only produce 5 and 10 respectively. 

<P>
In this example, some might believe that the USA should produce its own butter and its own guns, considering it is more efficient at both. However this is incorrect, because gains from trade are through comparative advantage not absolute advantage, as we will see.

This table of comparative advantage, we see that in order for the USA to produce another unit of butter, it must forgo 1.7 units of input. Whereas Canada must only forgo 0.5 units of input. So Canada has a lower opportunity cost in producing butter, and has a comparative advantage. 

<P>
Likewise, the USA only must use 0.6 units of input per gun produced, whereas Canada must use 2 units of input, so the USA has a comparative advantage in the production of guns.

<P>
So the USA should specialize in the production of guns and Canada should specialize in the production of butter, and they can trade. Whenever the opportunity costs differ,

To make intuitive sense of this scenario, consider a self-employed lawyer with a receptionist. The lawyer may both be a faster typist and well as a better lawyer. However, should the lawyer do clerical work in addition to the legal work? Intuitively, you think no. 

<P>
This is because the lawyer can devote their time entirely to legal work at $500/hr, then pay the receptionist $20/hr. The opportunity cost of devoting time to clerical work is higher than paying a less efficient typist. Again, this is because the absolute advantage is not important in comparison to the comparative advantage.

The first benefit of comparative advantage is that it enables specialization and trade, which increases total output. The second advantage of comparative advantage is that specialization then can lead to decreased costs, leading to further increases in total output.

In summary: A current account deficit is financed by a capital account surplus, meaning the deficit is financed by borrowing on the capital account. A current account surplus is balanced by a capital account deficit, meaning the surplus is balanced by loaning out the capital account. 

<P>
You might be wondering, why doesn't Canada just hold onto that $50B for later? The reason is that Canadians don't actually have $50B, but rather they are owed $50B, which is held in the form of stocks, bonds, shares, or some interest-earning form, so it will appear in the capital account as an outflow.

<P>
This also brings us to the idea of <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mercantalism</SPAN>. Historically, this meant that a country's wealth was its gold. Nowadays, it is the idea that surpluses and exports are favourable and that deficits and imports are unfavourable. This is untrue, there is nothing inherrently good or bad about surpluses or deficits, because gains from trade have entirely to do with comparative advantage, not a "favourable" balance of trade.

Is a current account deficit good or bad?</A>

<P>
Recall that gains from trade are the result of comparative advantage - and these gains have nothing to do with whether there is a trade deficit or a trade surplus. More important than the balance of trade is the volume of trade. 

<P>
The question "Should Canada have a current account deficit?" is the same as the question "Should Canadians be net sellers of assets to foreigners?" Is this good or bad? It really depends on circumstances. One one hand, it's not necessarily a good thing to be in debt to foreigners and have to pay them back with interest; on the other-hand, an influx of income now could mean advantageous opportunities to invest. So the answer is not clear cut. 

<P>
Recall that <!-- MATH
 $CA = (S-I)+(T-G)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, and Canada is said to have a current account deficit if <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, so an increase in the level of investment, a decrease in the level of private saving, or an decrease in <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> would all increase the current account deficit. 

<P>
Suppose business opportunities in Canada are booming, so private investment <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> increases. This would increase the current account deficit, but it would increase output, employment, and available capital, so that's hardly a decidedly bad thing. 

<P>
Suppose on the otherhand people are pessimistic about the future and begin putting their money into  savings instead of investing, then there would be a current account surplus, but that's hardly a good thing. 

<P>
So as we have seen the important subject to focus on is the underlying cause of a current account deficit or surplus, because whether it is negative or positive may reflect either good economic developments or bad ones.

This sort of sounds like it should make sense from a high-level perspective. If it costs more to buy a sweater in Canada than to import one from Japan, people would buy more from Japan, driving up the demand, and equalizing the prices.

But is this true? No, not really. We know from experience that you can buy a lot more with the same amount of money if you go from Canada to Vietnam. This requires something called the identical basket of goods, meaning that the goods are exactly the same and have the exact same world price. 

<P>
In reality, when you compare national price indices such as GDP deflator or the CPI, the basket of goods are not the same. This is because 1) countries produce different goods so there are different relative prices between countries, and 2) some goods (such as crushed rock, houses, or haircuts) aren't traded because it's not worth the transportation cots or is impractical.

Should Canada have a fixed exchange rate?</A>

Advocates of a fixed exchange rate, for instance against the USD, note that this would avoid fluctuations with the CAD-USD exchange rate. These fluctuations generate uncertainty for importers and exporters, increasing trade costs. 

<P>
On the otherhand, flexible exchange rates dampen the effects on GDP and employment from external shocks, like "shock absorbers". 

<P>
Let's say a reduction in world demand for lumber drives world prices down, so they're a reduction in demand for Canadian exports, and thus a reduction in demand for Canadian currency - ie. a reduction in the supply of foreign exchange. So this reduces exports, thus reduces GDP, thus shifts AD to the left.

<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">With fixed exchange rates</SPAN> - Since the supply curve moves to the left, but the exchange rate is fixed, this means there is an excess demand for foreign exchange. To satisfy this demand, the central bank sells foreign exchange reserves. So we remain at the same exchange rate, but have opened up a recessionary gap, so GDP and employment fall. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">With flexible exchange rates</SPAN> - The reduction in the supply of foreign exchange increases exchange rates,  so the CAD depreciates. The AD curve will still shift to the left, but now it will not shift so far, so the recessionary gap is less severe. Also, note that although lumber has gone down, due to the depreciation of the dollar, other industries may expand their markets.

<P>
So there is a tradeoff between depreciation of the currency and the severity of the output and employment gaps. Additionally, flexible exchange rates can be unattractive in terms of uncertainty.

US trade Deficit with China</A>
</H3>

<P>
So China has fixed its exchange rate too high with the USD, so it has depreciated its currency significantly. Their goal is to stimulate Chinese economic growth by undervaluing their currency so they can export products for so cheap that there is high demand for Chinese exports. 

<P>
In order to keep their currency low, China has to constantly buy USD or US treasury bills which increases the demand for USD and increases the dollar value compared to the Chinese Yuan (CNY). 

<P>
Then China loans these USD to the US at low rates. However it also loans out its own bonds at a higher interest rate. So one of the costs of this is that they lose money by earning low interest on the USD and paying high interest on the CNY. 

<P>
The other, main cost of this process is that by printing so much CNY to keep their currency undervalued, it creates high inflationary pressures. 

<P>
How can the US respond to this? They could place tariffs on Chinese imports and start a Trade War, but this would discourage growth and create inflation in the US because imports would increase in price. 

<P>
Alternatively, they could simply encourage savings and investment, rather than buy imports. This would create long-run gain for short-term pain.

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Undervalued currency</SPAN> is currency that cannot buy as much abroad as it can at home - ie. the purchasing power is lower abroad. This means that the exchange rate is too high and the currency is highly depreciated <!-- MATH

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Overvalued currency</SPAN> is currency that can buy more abroad than it can buy at home (the purchasing power is higher abroad), so the exchange rate is very low.
