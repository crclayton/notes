Power is the most restrictive factor and has dominated the constraints for high performance, especially in mobile devices. 

<P>
There are two kinds of power consumption:

<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Dynamic power</SPAN> - Losses when switching transistors between high and low, which causes some current to flow, and transistors/wires have nonzero capacitance

Historically, static power losses has been negligible in comparison to dynamic power, but static power has increased significantly in recent years because there are so many more transistors on a device, thus there is more leakage, and in addition, the transistors are smaller which means more leakage. The goal for static power is round 25% of total power consumption, and up to 40% for high performance systems.

Dynamic power is obviously dependent on voltage as a square, but voltage and frequency are actually directly related as well, so power is related to voltage as a cubic.

Slowing the clock rate reduces power consumption, but not energy. This is slightly counter-intuitive, but imagine yourself lifting a weight. If you lift the weight from 2ft to 4ft, the amount of energy (work) done is the same no matter how fast you do it because you've only increased the potential energy by 2ft. However, the power (rate of work) exerted is higher the faster the weight is lifted.

When transistors get smaller, they are less capacitive and thus can switch faster, so the frequency can be increased. Additionally, smaller transistors require less voltage. And finally, smaller transistors mean more available space on the chip. So you can get drastic performance improvements simply by making transistors smaller, and up until the end of Moore's law, much of EE was focused on doing just that.

MIPS</A>
</H2>

<P>
This is the language that is the focus of the course. It is a very clean architecture, and an example of a well-designed language. 

<P>
All the instructions are the same size, and thus the program is easy to decode. It uses the load-store architecture, meaning that all arithmetic is register-to-register. Some languages can have functions such as "add register 5 to memory location 17", but MIPS does everything with registers. This separates memory from computations. MIPS also maximizes its hardware reuse. 

<P>
In many processors, even the x86 instruction set is recompiled into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>ops, which is a language very similar to MIPS. x86 is maintained largely in order to provide legacy support.

<P>
MIPS is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) instruction set architecture. One of the first modern architectures was the PentiumPro, which had a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) ISA, and could execute instructions out-of-order, speculatively. This was around the mid '90s.

Registers</A>
</H3>

<P>
There are 32 general-purpose 64-bit registers, R0-R31. R0 is always 0, and assignments to R0 are ignored. Additionally, there are 32 floating-point registers, F0-F31, that are either 32 of 64-bits.

<P>
The PC (Program Counter) is a register that points to the next instruction to be executed. When a jump instruction is made, the PC is modified to be the address of the label. Otherwise, every execution cycle the PC is incremented by 4 bytes, because each MIPS instruction is 32 bits, so the PC points to the next instruction in memory.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00046500000000000000">
Memory</A>
</H3>

<P>
The 32 general purpose registers are not enough to store the information needed for most programs. 32 registers can all be identified using 5 bits in the instruction encoding space, increasing the number of registers increases this valuable space. Additionally, registers take up more space and use more power. However, some registers are valuable because that can be written to and read from extremely fast and reduce the number of memory operations.

So on top of registers, all computers have random access memory  (RAM) to store data. All instructions are stored in memory. To retrieve data, you must know its address in the memory.

We have a sign-extension unit because if you read data from memory, some instructions will read 32-bits (word), 64-bits (double word), and some will read a byte. Let's say you're reading an 8-bit negative value <TT>11111111</TT> and you store it in a 64-bit register, then you'll get the value <TT>0000000...11111111</TT>, which isn't negative.

This is how we control the flow of a program, so not all instructions are executed in a sequence. Branches allow us to implement conditions and loops. For instance, branch if equal to zero, or branch if these two registers are not equal.

Conditional branches depend on what is coming out of the registers. In order to do this we need to be able to read our two registers and feed them to the ALU for our comparison - often a subtraction until the result is zero.

We also need to figure out the next instruction to be taken. If the branch is to be taken, we need to take the next instruction and add the branch offset, which is relative to the PC.

The reason for the sign extend is so that we can branch both forward and backward, using the sign-extend to allow us to add a negative offset. We shift the instruction left by two because the lower two bits of the instruction address are always zero.

The main benefit of the assembly line wasn't only specialization, it was that since there were multiple cars being produced at once, different workers could be working on different elements of different cars simultaneously. 

<P>
Pipelining works best when tasks are broken up into specific sequential operations, which is why MIPS instructions are broken up into such rigid steps of instruction processing. 

<P>
If there are four steps in the process, the pipelining can be four times as fast as a sequential process. To pipelining to need some sort of state, like latches, to hold the value between operations.

Example - Floating Point Multiplier</A>
</H3>

<P>
In the case of an unpipelined multiplier, each result is completed before the next multiplication is started. But that means that after, for instance, the normalizing step is completed, the normalizing unit is doing nothing and just waiting for its next input.

<P>
With the pipelined version, latches are introduced in between each step. That way when the normalizing step is completed, it can immediately begin normalizing for the next operation. 

<P>
Note that there are multiple latches on the same wire in the pipelined version. This is because the exponent and the mantissa need to arrive at the output at the same time.

<P>
The other thing you want with pipelining is for the stages to have similarly timed latencies so that one operation isn't waiting for another to complete before the next operation can begin. This is why the third stage has three units, all of whom add up to a similar latency to the one block in the previous two stages.

<P>
This pipelining comes at a cost. Individual instructions can have more latency, because of the setup times and clk-to-output. You also need more storage to hold the intermediate values, and it costs more to implement these extra ICs.

<P>
Note that although you're breaking up this operation into three stages, you're not getting <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> the performance. In reality it's about <!-- MATH
 $\frac{400ns}{172ns} = 2.3\times$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> the performance. This is because not all stages have the exact same delay, so some stages will take longer and these will hold back the other stages. And as discussed, there is a little bit of overhead due to latch latency. 

<P>
However, you cannot always use a pipelined circuit for any sequence of floating point operations. If you are doing operations such as <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, you need to determine the final value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> before you can add <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>.

Name Dependency</A>

A name dependency is when two instructions use the same piece of hardware (usually register or memory location), but no data passes between them. That is, the dependency is on the data address (name), not the value. These cause a WAR hazard.

DSUB R4, R1, R3

For instance in the above instructions, <TT>R1</TT> is used for some initial operation, then reused for some second operation. This is an "anti-depedency" because it's not a true dependency, instead it results from the reuse of the R1 register. 

<P>
The first instruction must finish reading R1 before the second instruction writes to R1. If the first and second operations were reversed, this would change the result of the third instruction.

<P>
Because of this, is still a depedency because if the instructions are reordered there is a different result.

WAW hazards are now an issue. Assume it takes five cycles to do floating point addition instruction, then you do an integer addition instruction afterward which takes one cycle afterward.

Out-of-Order (OoO) execution is important because some instructions do not have dependencies on the previous instructions. If these instructions are executed in order, then it's possible while one that requires a dependency is stalling, the following instructions are being stalled unnecessarily.

Tomasulo algorithm</A>

<P>
Registers in instructions are renamed to tags. Each destination register gets a fresh tag, and the tag is mapped to the register in the register alias table (RAT). Source registers get corresponding tags from the RAT. 

<P>
This way we track data dependencies directly and there are no WAW or WAR hazards, only true dependencies in RAW hazards. 

<P>
Reservation stations (RSs) are put in from of each functional unit. This way we can buffer instructions that are waiting for operands. 

<P>
When the results are computed, the result and the tag of the source is broadcast on the common data bus (CDB). As RSs listen to the CDB for tags they want values for.

This eliminates two of our three hazards, but it is complicated to implement, and it requires a lot of hardware which has high capacitance and limits speed.

Speculative Execution</A>
</H2>

<P>
Speculative execution is somewhat similar to prices exceptions, because if you choose incorrectly you have to make sure you cancel purge any instructions that have been completed as part of a mispredicted path. 

<P>
Statistically, most branches are taken. Think of loops, usually they branch back to the same location, then at the end of the loop continue. All high-performance CPUs are speculative. The compiler can usually product the outcome with about 85% accuracy, then the hardware can predict it with 95-98% accuracy.

Label: DMUL    R4, R4, R2

<P>
Suppose the branch is mispredicted to be taken, then R4 would be modified in the register file, and when we cancelled the instruction we would have lost the correct value of R4. So we cannot let DMUL write to the register file until we know this is the correct branch.

Here we can see the issue is writing to the RF, not speculating or finishing the computation early. To fix this we can compute the result, but delay writing to the RF until we know the previous instructions weren't speculative and didn't throw exceptions.

<P>
To do this, we will split writeback into two stages called completion and commit. Completion means we have computed the result so instructions afterward can read it, but you don't write it to the RF yet. Then you commit once you know you're safe.

The issue stage allocates reservation stations and ROB entries. Here we keep track of the PC in case there's an exception or an mispredicted branch we need to continue from. We also keep track of the destination register to store the value in. We also need to keep track of which branch the instruction came from and whether it was speculative or not.

Some of these are very complicated, but the vast majority of addressing modes that are used by the compiler are simple addressing modes like Immediate (for constants), Displacement (for local variables), and some Register Indirect (for pointers).

<P>
Between each stage we have <SPAN  CLASS="textit">pipeline registers</SPAN> to store the immediate values. In the first half of each clock cycle, these are written to by the preceding stage, and in the second half of the clock cycle, they are read the the following stage. These registers also carry intermediate values from one stage to another where the stage isn't needed. 

<P>
For instance, in a store instruction the value is read in ID but EX just passes it along to MEM.  Similarly, in an ALU instruction MEM just passes the value from EX to WB without doing anything in memory.

<P>
Pipelining increases the CPU instruction throughput, the number of instruction per time, but increases the amount of time it takes to complete each instruction because of pipeline register delay. The more balanced the stages, the better the performance because no stage is sitting idle.

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Structural hazards</SPAN> - Resource conflicts when two instructions want to use the same hardware. For instance, you might only have one ALU and one instruction is the ID stage and wants to compute the effective address for the PC, while another instruction is in the EX stage and wants to do a subtraction.

Forwarding</A>
</H3>

<P>
Data hazards can be mitigated by using forwarding, this way we can reduce the number of stalls.

<P>
The result of an ALU operation is known by the end of the EX stage. So an instruction that's dependent on that value doesn't need to wait until it's finished the MEM and WB stages. The result of a load operation is known by the end of the MEM stage, so we don't need to wait until the WB stage is completed. 

<P>
This requires some extra hardware called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">pipeline interlock</SPAN>. 

<P>
The values stored in the EX/MEM register or the MEM/WB register can be fed back to the ALU input directly. If we detect that the previous ALU operation will write to a register that is the source for a current ALU operation, then we know to forward. Control logic switches the ALU input to be from the forwarded result rather than the register file, and we don't have to stall.

<P>
If any of the source registers in the ID/EX or the EX/MEM registers are the destination registers in the EX/MEM or the MEM/WB registers, we know we should forward.

Branch Hazards</A>

<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Control hazards</SPAN> can cause worse performance than our data hazards. 

<P>
When a branch is executed it could either be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">taken</SPAN> and increment the PC by some offset to the target address, or it could be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not taken</SPAN> and increment by four to go to the next instruction. If the instruction is taken, it will update the PC at the end of the ID stage. 

<P>
The next instruction will be stalled for one cycle until the IF stage knows what instruction to fetch from the updated PC. One stall for every branch will have a significant performance loss.

<P>
Alternatively, you could assume all branches are not taken and before you know the target address if taken or even if it is taken, you can begin to execute the next instruction as if the PC was incremented by four. If the branch is not taken, continue as normal. If it is taken, you must be able to back out by converting the instruction to a NOP and ensure that nothing has been irreversibly changed and you haven't lost any register values or anything.

A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">branch history table</SPAN> is created that hashes the lower portion of the instruction address to a bit that indicates whether the branch was taken last time or not. 

<P>
A one bit scheme will make two mispredictions per loop even if a branch is almost always consistently taken or not taken. By increasing it to two bits, and implementing a policy that we must mispredict twice in a row before changing our assumption, we reduce this to one misprediction per loop.

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Sync vs. async</SPAN> - Synchronous exceptions happen at the time place every time the program is executed.

</OL>

<P>
By the time the exception happens, a few instructions could be in flight. The pipeline state and the PC must be saved and shut down so that it can be restarted after the exception has been fixed.

Multicycle Operations</A>

<P>
Before we assumed that the EX stage took only one cycle. Floating-point operations take many cycles to complete. We cannot make all instructions take the same amount of time, because then we'd have extremely deep pipelines, or a slow clock, or massive amounts of logic, and our stalls would be very long.

<P>
For these instructions the EX cycle is repeated until the operation is complete. There also are multiple function units (FUs), one for integer operations, one FP and integer multipliers, on FP adder, and one FP divider. Each of these FUs has different latencies.

<P>
These functional units are split into microinstructions (M1, M2, M3... for multiplication and A1, A2, A3... for addition) which can then also be pipelined. This requires additional pipeline registers called (M1/M2, M2/M3...).

Because these operations take different amounts of time to complete, we get <SPAN  CLASS="textit">out-of-order completion</SPAN>. A multiplication instruction that begins before a load instruction can complete after the load completes. These are new hazards.

Hazards and Forwarding in Longer Latency Pipelines</A>
</H3>

<P>
Because these instructions take more than five cycles to complete, stalls have a much greater penalty and RAW hazards will become more frequent. 

<P>
This also introduces a new hazard, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">write-after-write</SPAN> (WAW). Since instructions don't reach the WB stage in order, a later instruction writing to register R1 could complete before a previous instruction writing to register R1. This means that the intended value stored in R1 would be overwritten. These hazards only occur when an instruction that didn't need to be executed is completed, because it will be overwritten anyway. However, these instances happen, for instance at the end of a loop right before the loop is exited. 

<P>
We can deal with WAW hazards by detecting them in the ID stage and either stalling the second write until the first write is completed, or recognizing the first write is useless and converting it to a NOP. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Write-after-read</SPAN>(WAR) instructions are not an issue however, since the register reads always occur in ID which are executed in order.

<P>
Also, different FUs may complete their execution in the same clock cycle, and both try to WB or MEM at the same time. These create structural hazards, for instance if there is only one write port to the register file.

<P>
There are three checks we must do with pipelined functional units:

Simple pipelines fetch an instruction and then issue it unless it is dependent on another instruction already in the pipeline. They stall the instruction until the dependency can be forwarded.

Every instruction goes through the scoreboard in the issue stage and a record of the data dependencies is constructed.

Advanced Branch Prediction</A>
</H2>

<P>
Branch predictors predict whether to take or to not take a branch. 

<P>
The target PC is different from the instruction at the memory location pointed to by the PC. The PC is the address of memory location containing the next instruction, whereas the instruction is just the opcode and registers of the next instruction.

<P>
So if branch predictors predict whether to take the branch, the Branch Target Buffer (BTB) is a cache that predicts the target PC assuming the branch is taken.

<P>
The first time you see a branch, you stick the address (or a component of the address) of the branch in the tag component of a BTB row. After you resolve the branch, you put the address of the location we branched to in the target component. Next time we come to that address, if the branch is predicted as taken, we can predict the location where to branch to without resolving it. 

<P>
As we increase the number of instructions in flight, the accuracy of our branch prediction becomes more important. One way that we can improve our prediction scheme over the 1 or 2-bit predictor we discussed earlier is to take into account <SPAN  CLASS="textit">correlating branches</SPAN>. 

<P>
Correlating branches are branches for which the outcome depends on one-another, for instance consider this code in the eqntott benchmark. 

<P>
<PRE>
if (a == 2) a = 0;
if (b == 2) b = 0;
if (a != b) ...
</PRE>

<P>
Here, if the first two if statements are executed then the last if statement will not be executed. When compiled into MIPS, this means that when the branches b1 and b2 are taken, then b3 will be taken (note that the logic for true corresponding to taken may be inverted by the compiler to bias the code one way or another). 

<P>
Branch predictors may use the global behaviour of other branches to make predictions. This is done by looking at a history of recently executed branches. An <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> predictor looks at the behaviour of the last <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> branches to choose from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> branch predictors, each of which is an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>-bit predictor for a single branch. 

<P>
The 2-bit saturating counter we discussed previously is a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> predictor because it doesn't use any history of previously executed branches (meaning different branches, not this same branch executed a previous time), and it uses a 2-bits history to make its prediction.

<P>
A <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> correlating predictor outperforms a 2-bit saturating predictor not only with the same total number of bits, but with an unlimited number of entries.

Dynamic Scheduling using Tomasulo's Algorithm</A>
</H2>

<P>
In-order instruction issuing creates head-of-the-line blocking, as we have discussed earlier. With out-of-order execution we can execute non-dependent instructions while dependent instructions are stalling. However, recall that this introduces WAR and WAW hazards. 

<P>
It also complicates preserving precise exceptions, because instructions after the exception may have already been completed, and instructions before the exception may not have been completed. 

<P>
Previously we discussed dealing with this using scoreboarding, which allowed us to execute out-of-order when there were no structural hazards and there were no data dependencies. 

<P>
A more sophisticated technique of dealing with this is using <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Tomasulo's algorithm</SPAN>. This eliminates WAW and WAR hazards by using dynamic <SPAN  CLASS="textit">register-renaming</SPAN>. Recall these hazards only arise through reusing registers. 

<P>
RAW hazards are avoided by executing only when its operands are available, similar to the scoreboarding technique. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000112100000000000000">
Register-renaming</A>
</H3>

<P>
Register-renaming is provided by using <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reservation stations</SPAN>. 

<P>
Reservation stations buffer the operands of instructions waiting to be issued. This way, an operand is fetched and buffered in the reservation station as soon as it is available. This way it doesn't need to be fetched from a register, and the register can be overwritten. As instructions are issued, the source registers are renamed to the corresponding reservation station tags.

<P>
This way we can forget about registers and just track data dependencies directly. Each destination register gets a new tag, and that tag is mapped to in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">register alias table</SPAN> (RAT). These tags are basically an extended set of virtual registers.

<P>
All results from the FUs are broadcast on the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">common data bus</SPAN> (CDB), so all FUs waiting for an operand can load the result simultaneously. 

<P>
Each FU has a reservation station that holds an issued instruction waiting to be executed until the operands are available. 

<P>
Instructions are sent to the instruction queue, which will issue them in order. When the instructions are issued, they will be sent to reservations station which will hold the operation and the operands. 

<P>
The load and store buffers hold data or addresses coming from and going to memory until the effective address is computed. They behave almost exactly like reservation stations.

<P>
One of the main benefits of Tomasulo's algorithm is that if multiple instructions are waiting on a single result, since the result in broadcast on the CDB, both instructions can start simultaneously. If the result was going to a register file, then the instructions would have to fetch the value one at a time. 

<P>
The second is that we eliminate WAW and WAR hazards. For instance, consider the following code: 

<P>
<PRE>
L.D     F6,  32(R2)
L.D     F2,  44(R3)
MUL.D   F0,  F2,  F4
SUB.D   F8,  F2,  F6
DIV.D   F10, F0,  F6
ADD.D   F6,  F8,  F2
</PRE>

<P>
We can issue both the <TT>DIV.D</TT> and the <TT>ADD.D</TT> even though they have a WAR hazard on F6. 

<P>
If the value of F6 has been loaded, then its value has been stored in the reservation station for the <TT>DIV.D</TT>, so even if the <TT>ADD.D</TT> executes before the <TT>DIV.D</TT> and overwrites F6, we won't lose the previous value.

<P>
If the value of F6 has not yet been loaded, then the <TT>DIV.D</TT> reservation station would point to the result of the load FU and wait for it, and grab the value regardless if <TT>ADD.D</TT> is overwriting the F6 register.

Now we will fetch, issue, and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">execute</SPAN> as if our branch predictions are always correct. Operations will now execute as soon as their operands are available. 

<P>
We also need to be able to handle the situation and revert when our speculations are incorrect.

</OL>

<P>
We now extend Tomasulo's algorithm to allow an instruction to execute and forward its results, without actually performing any updates that can't be undone until we know we made the right prediction. This is like doing a speculative register-read. 

<P>
When the branch is resolved and we know we made the right prediction, we can update the register file or memory in an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">instruction commit</SPAN>. This allows us to execute out-of-order, but prevent any irrevertable changes by <SPAN  CLASS="textit">committing in-order</SPAN>. 

<P>
We implement this change by incorporating the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reorder buffer</SPAN> (ROB). This provides additional registers like a reservation station, and it holds the result of an instruction after it is executed but before it is committed. It is a source of operands for instructions just like the reservation station.

If the branch was correctly predicted, we continue.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
(???) How do we know the branch was correctly predicted? 

<P>
One advantage of the ROB is now the processor can dynamically and speculatively execute code while maintaining a precise exception model, because we only commit instructions in-order. If there are any mispredictions or exceptions, the processor can undo all actions by not committing if the instruction is found to be a misprediction or an exception. 

<P>
We still have the benefit of avoiding WAW and WAR hazards because actual updating of memory occurs in order. When an instruction is at the head of the ROB, no earlier instructions can still be pending.

RAW hazards are still avoided through stalls.

Assume non-memory operations take one cycle, which is <!-- MATH

Spatial Locality</A>

<P>
This is the other kind of locality we can consider. Programs are fairly predictable in that they do the same thing over and over again, and both of the kinds of locality are very predictable. If you access data in one place, then you may also be interested in data nearby. For instance, look at the following code.

<PRE>
Y[2] = a*X[2] + Y[2];
Y[3] = a*X[3] + Y[3];

<P>
First we read <code>Y[2]</code> then <code>Y[3]</code>. Perhaps when we cache the value of <code>Y[2]</code>, we then could also transfer a bigger chunk adjacent data. This way, we would not have to go into memory when we go to access <code>Y[3]</code>. We will call these bigger chunks <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cache blocks</SPAN>.

<P>
Memory is divided into blocks that are aligned in memory. In CPUs, a typical block size is 64-bytes and in GPUs it is 128-bytes.

To do this we will have to change our cache. We will expand the data to contain an entire block rather than one memory location. We could also make our tag shorter as we only need to identify the blocks, not the memory address. 

<P>
The lower <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> bytes of the memory address in an instruction simply identify the location within the block. For instance, with a fully associative cache of 8-byte blocks, the last 3-bits are dedicated to identifying the memory address within the block.

When the memory address is <TT>0x0000001XXX</TT> is accessed, the bits <TT>XXX</TT> identify the location within the block in the cache - called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">block offset</SPAN>.

<P>
There is a data cache with 16 byte blocks, and a 4-byte float starting at address <TT>0x00008028</TT>. What is the block offset?

<P>

<P>
The number of bits devoted to the offset is <!-- MATH

They're very big because you have to store each entry and have to store almost a full address instead of more data. But more importantly, it's very time consuming to iterate through each row in the cache to see if the tag corresponds to what we're looking for. 

<P>
So instead of searching all rows, we're going to use a hash to map each address directly to a row in the cache. This is called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Direct Mapped Cache</SPAN>. Just by knowing the address, we will know where in the cache the data would be stored.

<P>
We will split the block address into a tag and an index. The index will indicate which row in the cache to store our data.

There will be some collisions because the hash will map some of the same points in memory to the same row in the cache. So we will also keep the tag to reconcile whether the cache contains the data in the memory we're interested in, or some other memory that is mapped to the same location in the cache.

In simpler terms, recall that we have 8 entries in the cache - so we only need 3-bits to identify which entry in the cache. So identify the last 3-bits after we drop the 5-bits for the block offset, and that's our index.

<P>
Assume our cache is 1024 entries in 4-byte blocks, and this is our address memory address <TT>0b1111 1010 0001 0000</TT>.

<P>
The last <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> bits are dedicated to the offset, so our offset is <TT>00</TT>. The next <!-- MATH
 $log_2(1024) = 10$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> bits are our index, so our index is <TT>1010 0001 00</TT>. The remaining bits are our tag, so our tag is <TT>1111</TT>.

<P>
Now let's look at how this is implemented in hardware. First we split the address into the offset, the index, and the tag. 

<P>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
Then we use the index to locate the row in the cache. We read the tag and the data from that row. If the tag from the cache matches the tag from the address and the valid bit is set, we have a cache hit and so we raise the hit flag and retrieve the data.

<P>
A problem with the direct map cache is conflicts - if we want to repeatedly access different addresses that map to the same row in the cache, then even if we have enough space in the cache to accommodate all the memory we want, because the cache is direct mapped we will continuously overwrite the data we want to keep in the cache.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000122700000000000000">
Set-Associative Cache</A>
</H3>

<P>
In order to deal with conflicts, the set-associative cache combines some features of the fully-associative cache with some features of the direct-mapped cache.

<P>
The idea is that we will use the cache index to select a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">set</SPAN> of blocks. In the direct-mapped cache we select one block, but here we select a set of 4-16 blocks. Then we treat this set of blocks like a small fully-associative cache. 

<P>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
When the cache does a lookup, it indexes to the row of 4-16 different direct-mapped caches, creating a set of tags. Then we compare each tag in parallel to determine if any of them are a hit. If so, we will retrieve the data from the block with a matching tag using a mux. 

<P>
If there is a cache miss, we will only add them to empty entries. There will never be a situation in which two of the tables both return a hit.

<P>
Note that the number of ways does not need to be a power of two. It is independent of the index. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000122800000000000000">
Example</A>
</H3>

<P>
How many sets (rows) is in a 4-way set associative cache containing a total of 32 16-byte blocks.

<P>
--

<P>
We 32 blocks and each block contains 16-bytes, and these are split between the four ways. 

<P>
So 32 blocks/4 = 8 blocks per way. The cache can have 8 sets.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000122900000000000000">

</H3>

<P>
For a 4-way set associative cache containing a total of 32 16-byte blocks, what is the index for a load with effective address <TT>0b0000 1000 0101 0100</TT>?

<P>
--

<P>
There are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> bits reserved for the offset. So ignore those.

<P>
There are 32 blocks, but there are 4 ways, so there are 8 blocks per way. Thus there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> bits required to index the 8 blocks. So the index is the bits <TT>101</TT>.

Let's say you're analyzing two potential designs for caches.

<LI>A 2-way set associative cache with 2-byte blocks and 16-bytes total

The memory references are as follows 2, 3, 2, 8, 10, 2. Label the hits and the misses, and show the final cache contents.

With option (1), there are 8 rows indexed by 3 bits. With option (2), there are four rows indexed by 2 bits, but each row holds two addresses.

Reuse Distance</A>

<P>
What do you do when the cache or set is full? Of course you need to replace things, but how do you decide what blocks to evict/replace?

<P>
If you remove the oldest data, you are taking advantage of temporal locality, but may not be taking advantage of spatial locality, and vice-versa. 

<P>
The optimal balance is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">B&#233;l&#225;dy-optimal replacement</SPAN> - whereby you replace blocks re-referenced furthest in the future. The idea is that everything before that, you will need sooner, so it better be in the cache. 

<P>
However, the hardware does not know the future, so we need some prediction mechanism. We will do this using <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reuse distance</SPAN>.

<P>
Consider the sequence of block accesses: <TT>ABBCBCCDBBEDBBBA</TT>. If you just look at A, there are 14 accesses between the two A accesses. In those 14 accesses, count how many unique blocks are accessed. In this case, there are four unique blocks, B, C, D and E. That means the reuse distance for A is 4.

Replacement Policy</A>
</H3>

<P>
This is how we will decide what blocks to evict. In general, you want to replace the least frequently used (LFU) data, or the least recently used (LRU) data. And actually random replacement works better than you would expect as well. 

<P>
To keep track of the LRU in a two-way associative cache, it would require one LRU bit. If you most recently accessed the data on the left channel, the LRU bit will point to the left (say a 0). If you most recently accessed the data on the right channel, the bit will point to the left (a 1). 

<P>
Then when you need to replace the data in a block, replace the block that the LRU bit is not pointing to. If the bit is 0, replace the right, otherwise replace the left.

<P>
If there are more than two ways, there are many choices for pseudo-LRU because perfect LRU is actually quite tricky. 

<P>
The most common and simple implementation is having one most-recently used (MRU) bit per block. Any time you use the block, set the bit to 1. Then once all bits have been set to 1, set all bits to 0 and restart the process. This isn't perfect, but it's pretty good.

<P>
A more sophisticated method is to have some kind of prediction number (reference prediction value) per block that is a prediction of when the block will be reference. When you insert a value into the cache or you have a hit, you set the value to maximum. Then over time you decrement the value over time. Every block's RRPV will decrement over time, but whenever you have a hit it will be refreshed to have a high value so it won't be replaced.

<P>
In each elbow of the following graph, that indicates that your array has exceeded the size of the cache and you start missing.

Cache Misses</A>
</H3>

<P>
There are three main kinds of misses.

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cold start</SPAN> (also called Compulsory) - You will have cold start misses when your cache is empty or when you access a block for the first time. Increasing the cache size does not improve your performance for cold-start misses, the only thing that you can do is take advantage of spatial locality by increasing block size. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Capacity misses</SPAN> - This misses come from when your cache is not big enough. You used to have the value but needed to use that space for something else. If your cache was infinitely large, then you would never have capacity misses. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Conflict misses</SPAN> - These come from when you have a direct mapped cache and multiple things map to one entry. You would not have conflict misses if you had a fully associative cache. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Let's say you had a 2-byte directed mapped cache with 1-byte blocks. For the reference stream 0, 2, 2, 0 the second access to 0 misses. This miss will be a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">conflict</SPAN> miss because both 0 and 2 map to the same one block. So the previously stored value from 0 has been replaced.

<P>
For the same cache, let's say you had the reference stream 0, 1, 2, and the access to 2 missed. This would be a cold start miss because it's the first time we access 2.

<P>
Again with the same cache, let's say the reference stream was 0, 1, 2, 0. The second access to 0 misses. This would be a capacity miss.

You can see that as cache increases, the capacity miss rate goes down. You can also increase the number of ways which reduces conflict misses. In the end you're left mostly with mostly cold-start misses. 

<P>
However, if your cache block size increases too much, your miss rate will increase. Imagine your cache block size was the size of the entire cache, if it's too big then your cache is too dependent on spatial locality and will crowd out entries that take advantage of temporal locality. If your cache block size is too small however, then you will not be taken enough advantage of temporal locality.

Upon store operations, there are different ways of updating memory. With the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">write-through</SPAN> structure, both the cache and the main memory are updated from the CPU.

Both of these strategies take use of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">write buffer</SPAN> to allow the cache to proceed as soon as the data are placed in the buffer. This means they do not have to wait all the time required for the update in main memory.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION000130000000000000000">
Virtual Memory</A>
</H1>

<P>
The main problem that virtual memory solves is that the operating system wants to multitask. It wants to run multiple programs simultaneously. If you have one processor that can run one thread, then your operating system can switch among multiple processes. 

<P>
It's convenient to assume that all programs assume that address space starts at 0. That way you can write your program one way where you assume where the program will be in memory, and you can run on any machine. 

<P>
Additionally, your computer may not have enough physical RAM to run all the programs at once. If you were running your operating system and your browser and your excel simultaneously, you would run out of physical memory and your PC would crash. 

<P>
Moreover these programs want a continuous range of addresses, not memory segmented into different chunks in different places in hardware. 

<P>
To solve this, we want each program to have a separate address space that begins at 0. We want to create the illusion for programmers and computer scientists that everything is normal and each program has its own <SPAN  CLASS="textit">address space ID</SPAN> (ASID). So two programs executing simultaneously each thinks it has a separate copy of address 0 and address 1 and so one. These addresses are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual addresses</SPAN> (VA).

<P>
As for real hardware memory, we will call these <SPAN  CLASS="textit">physical addresses</SPAN> (PA). The CPU and the operating system will translate the VA to the PA. So programs with the same VA do not map to the same PA if they are in different ASIDs. 

<P>
We will split the memory into equal sized <SPAN  CLASS="textit">pages</SPAN>, and we will keep a mapping between virtual pages and physical pages. 

<P>

</DIV>

<P>
Even if physical memory is smaller than virtual memory, we can map virtual addresses to disk addresses. This means in the program view of memory, memory is continuous, starts at 0, and you can always allocate more. In reality, the memory is fragmented, so it is non-continuous, out-of-order, and some is on the disk.

<P>
To do this address translation, we will use a look-up table to determine the PA of VA. So we will have our virtual page number, which we translate to a physical page memory, but we don't change the page offset. If there are 12-bits for the page offset, then a page is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> = 4096 bytes = 4KB. 

<P>
First we need to have a register in the CPU that tells us where the look-up table is. And for each process that is running, we need a separate page table, so we will change this page table register.

<P>

<P>
Note that the page table register holds a physical address because we need the page table to convert PA to VA. If the page table register was a VA, then we don't yet know how to translate it. 

<P>
If there are 30-bit physical addresses and 32-bit virtual addresses. The page offset is 12 bits, so we have 20 remaining bits for the physical address. So the page table is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> = 1048576 = 1M entries. 

<P>
An address translation is required not only for every data memory instruction, but for every instruction fetch since instructions are stored in memory. So for memory and load instructions, two address translations must be done.

<P>
We can't store these page tables near the CPU in a cache because they're just too big, but we also can't store them in main memory because doing translations every instruction would be unreasonably slow.

<P>
We know that each process needs its own page table because each process has its own address space. However, page tables are sparse. Most programs don't use all of their address space, so allocating an entire page table for every process is inefficient. So we create variable-size page tables and break them up into multiple levels.

<P>
The top-level table is in reserved in RAM. The next-level table can either be in RAM or in the disk based on the OS, and are not reserved, they are created and torn down as needed. 

<P>
This allows us to use much less memory total than if we had a page table for every process. 

<P>
So in our 32-bit virtual address, we break it up into two different indices and the page offset. The highest 10 bits represent the P1 index, the next 10 bits represent the P2 index, and the lowest 12 bits represent the page offset. 

<P>
These lower levels however are still stored in main memory, which is way too slow. So we will cache the page table in a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">translation lookaside buffer</SPAN> (TLB). 

<P>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
The TLB is just a cache for the page table. The first level caches are fully-associative because it's less likely you'll have locality on a page-by-page level and it's fairly small. 

<P>
When we get a VA, first we check in the TLB, if the address is valid and we if we have a corresponding PA, then we can access the physical memory in one cycle. This way we don't have to access the page table in the RAM or the disk. 

<P>
If we have a miss, then we have to go to traverse the page table structure in memory, follow some pointers, and find the value. In x86 this is done in hardware, in MIPS it is done in software.

<P>
We also have to be concerned about rights. So if the page table is updated, the memory is updated, and vice-versa. We do this by using a "dirty" bit that indicates when a page table has been written. We can also include a read-only bit, in the event that multiple processes are running the same program and need to point at the same memory. If you write to it, you may interfere with the other process. You also may want an "execute" bit for security reasons, where you want to indicate some value is "data" and to never execute it so a buffer overflow hack can't get you to execute malicious code.

<P>
First you access the TLB. If you have a miss, you let the operating system figure out the exception. If you have a hit, then find the physical address.  If it's not a write read the data from the cache and check if you have a cache hit then get the data from the cache and we're done. If it's a miss then wait for the MSHR to tell us where the data is. If it's a write then update the tag, and it's not a write then throw an exception telling the operating system that someone is trying to write to protected memory.

<P>
We will translate the VA to the PA in parallel while you use the VA to access the data cache. Then use the PA to verify the tag is correct. 

<P>
If we have a virtually addressed cache and we switch from one process to another. Then we have to flush the cash because we would be looking at incorrectly translated VA to PAs. Flushing the cache takes up a substantial proportion of time, so instead of this we use ASID as well as the VA to address the data cache.

With RAM, you provide an address and the data is returned. There is no searching through the data like there is with associative lookup, rather you provide at tag and randomly access the data array.

For speed, you want the array to be roughly square, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>.

The horizontal rows are the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">wordlines</SPAN> and the vertical rows are the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">bitlines</SPAN>. 

<P>
To perform a read operation, you use the address to index a row and drive each cell on a row. This opens each cell and forces the cells to drive their respective bitlines. 

<P>
These cells are very small in order to make memory dense, which means they cannot drive strong signals on the long bitlines. So the bitlines are preconditioned somehow (different for SRAM and DRAM) and the cells either pull up or pull down the bitline, which is then amplified to a strong 0 or 1 with sense amplifiers.

<P>
To perform a write operation, again the wordline is indexed and driven by the address from the row decoder, which then opens up the cells on that row. Then the value to be stored drives the bitlines. Since the bitlines can be driven by a powerful signal and the cells are weak, the values stored in the cell are overpowered and the cells retain the data.

In SRAM, each bit is stored with an SRAM cell - essentially a back-to-back inverter. This is a positive feedback loop as each inverter reinforces the value of the other inverter, so there is no leakage.

As we said, to read a value from the SRAM cell, we precharge both the <code>bit</code> and <code>bit_b</code> (as in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">bit bar</SPAN>, the inverse) lines to high. Then we turn the wordline high to enable the access transistors ("enable the cell"). This will then ground one of the bitlines, which will tell us the value in the SRAM cell.

<P>
To write, we set the bitline to the value we want to store (and the inverse bitline to the opposite). One of the lines will then be high, and this will overpower the logic in the cross-coupled inverters and save the value.

However, you may want to read or write to different sets of bits (words) on the wordline separately. However, with this SRAM cell, you only have one port so you cannot individually index words on the wordline. For instance, in the MIPS architecture, when reading instructions you may need to read two different operands from the register file in one cycle. Or you may want to read and write different words in the same cycle. To do this, we need multi-ported SRAM cells.

<P>
If you want to take this further and simultaneously read and write from a cell, you cannot use this from the above cells. Consider this example register file cell, it has separate read and write lines.

A DRAM cell is just one capacitor and transistor. It is very small so it is very dense and cheap. Since the capacitor is so small, it is very weak and cannot pull a bitline fully up or fully down, so we precharge the bitline to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>, so when the DRAM cell is opened up, it only slightly drags down the voltage or slightly bumps it up. This slight disturbance is then amplified to be a zero or a one.

<P>
When we read a value from a DRAM cell it is called destructive because we lose the former value of the DRAM cell, so we must write-back values we read. The capacitor also leaks and loses charge over time, so we must occasionally refresh the DRAM cells by reading and writing back the values. Currently they are refreshed around once every 64ms.

This is not manufactured using the same logic as typical CMOS. The transistor must be strong enough to drive a large bitline, but weak enough that it can be overwritten easily, so it is bigger than logic transistors.

<P>
To do our refresh or to write-back the value after we read it, we use a register called the row buffer. We read the array and store it in the row buffer, then send the data where it needs to go from the row buffer. 

<P>
The row buffer can be thought of as a tiny cache. If we immediately get another request to DRAM for the same address, then we already have the value in the row buffer so this is called a row buffer hit, and we can immediately pass the value along without reading from the DRAM. 

<P>
However if we get another request for a different address it is a miss, then we use the row-buffer to write the values back into the last DRAM row and then get the new value requested. We wait before writing back to avoid any potential unnecessary writes when there are hits. Before the row-buffer writes back the values, the row is said to be "open", after it has written them back it is said to be "closed".

To write to the CAM cell, it is the same as an SRAM cell, we charge the bitlines to the value, then set the wordlines to high and it will overpower the cross-coupled inverters.

If we expand the CAM cell out to an entire CAM structure, we get a situation where any mismatch of a cell and bitline in a row can set the row's matchline to zero. Only rows will exact matches will have a high matchline. These matchlines can then be sent to an OR gate which will tell us if there exists a match in memory.

Reservation station, TLB, branch target buffer, and load-store queue, can all use some sort of CAM because they look for some sort of match.

Memory Consistency</A>
</H1>

<P>
With multi-core processors, we must communicate between the cores using shared memory. If core 0 writes to a shared memory location and core 1 reads from that location, we need to ensure that the process in core 0 has completed first. You don't want to read data in a half-written state or incorrect data needed for dependencies.

<P>
To order accesses to shared memory, we can use flags. Consider the code in the two threads in Figure <A HREF="#Flag">51</A>. Thread B cannot continue until Thread A has set the flag, which will only occur after the data has been set to the updated value. 

<P>

<P>
This flag effectively communicates that thread A has finished storing the data and it is safe for thread B to load it. These restrictions are needed in both multi-cores and single-cores with multiple concurrent threads.

<P>
Memory access reordering happens in the compiler, inside the CPU core such as with store buffer or load-store queue, in the interconnect between cores/chips. It also can happen in DRAM, when there are reads of the address that is already stored in the row buffer, they may be prioritized over reads to other addresses because the data is already available and will take overall less time to give that first. 

<P>
The point of this is that memory access reordering happens very often, and we can find ourselves in trouble without a model to determine what reording is acceptable. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000151000000000000000">
Memory Consistency Model</A>
</H2>

<P>
A memory consistency model specifies what sequences of memory states are permissible. If there are multiple cores looking at the memory, the memory consistency model sets the rules for what different cores are allowed to see and modify what values of memory. To do this, each memory is given a state to keep track of what operations are allowable on it.

<P>
It also tells us which memory accesses are allowed to be reordered. This is due to the above states, for instance if one core is not permitted to read or write to a certain value, then it is clear there is some sort of dependency and reordering is not allowed, s it must wait until that state changes. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000151100000000000000">
Sequential Consistency (SC)</A>
</H3>

<P>
A processor is sequentially consistent if the result of any execution is the same as if the operations were operated in some sequential order. There doesn't have to be a specific sequential order, there can be many valid sequential orders, but it just needs to be consistent with one of those orders. (???) More importantly, the operations of each processor must appear in order specified in that processors program.

<P>
The instructions of each processor can be interleaved with each other in any order, but the order of operations must be in the program order in each individual processor. 

<P>
Let's say core 0 needed to execute instructions <code>A B C D</code> and core 1 needed to execute instructions <code>1 2 3 4</code>, then the following would be SC execution: <code>ABCD1234</code>, <code>A1B2C3D4</code>, <code>AB12CD34</code>, <code>1234ABCD</code>.  However, <code>ADBC1234</code> is not sequentially consistent because the order of one individual processor was not in program order. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000151200000000000000">

Core A                  Core B
A1: store X &lt;- 1        B1: store Y &lt;- 1
A2: load r1 &lt;- Y        B2: load r2 &lt;- X

B1 A1 B2 A2    1   1
B1 B2 A1 A2    1   0

<P>
However, the outcome could never be r1=0 and r2=0 because a store must always happen before a load.

<P>

<P>
Recall we spent some time discussing optimization with the store buffer or the load-store queue which provide us with something like 20-25% performance improvement. The store buffer allows loads to bypass stores because there aren't memory dependencies. However, this only checks for memory dependencies within one core. 

<P>
If we revisit the above example but include a store-buffer that moves a load before a store, then we can get the result r1=0 and r2=0, which is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> sequentially consistent.

<P>
To maintain SC, for all memory accesses within each core we have to maintain:

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Load-to-load ordering</SPAN> - If we swap two loads, then we will lose sequential consistency. For instance, consider the thread B in Figure <A HREF="#Flag">51</A>, the load of the flag must happen before the load of the data.

</LI>

<P>
However, this is inconvenient for performance purposes beacuse we lose the performance boosts we got from reordering with the store-buffer. The main cause of this issue however is the interleaving nature  of the cores.

Weak Ordering (WO)</A>

If we ensure that all the memory writes in one core are completed before the memory reads in the second core start, then we avoid these logical constraints. Then we can still allow reordering in the individual cores as allowable by the store-buffer, and not have to worry about dependency problems between the cores.

<P>
We will implement this by allowing arbitrary reordering <SPAN  CLASS="textit">except</SPAN> for synchronization operations. We will put a synchronization operation at the end of the writes in core 0, and put a synchronization operation at the beginning of the reads in core 1.

Fences could also be considered too strong of a constraint. The main concern between dependencies across different cores is one core, let's call it core 0, finishing all of its writes before the other core, core 1, begins its reads.

It is not actually a concern if loads in core 0 after the fence leak before the fence, or if stores in core 1 before the fence leak after the fence as long as there are not actual data dependencies.

Coherence</A>

<P>
Caches in multicores add another factor to the problem of consistency because multiple copies of a memory block can exist in the system. If memory is updated in one cache or in memory, how do we know that the cache of other cores is not providing that core with an out of date value. Our previously discussed consistency models do not address this.

<P>
Let's say core 0 does a load of memory address X, then core 1 does a load of memory address X. Then both cores have a copy of X in their cache. If core 0 then writes a value to address X its cache will be updated, but core 1 will have an incorrect value in its cache. 

<P>
Moreover, if both cores write a different value to address X, which value is written back to shared memory? This depends on which cache must evict the value first.

For a system to be coherent, we must break out memory accesses into read-only and write epochs. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Single Writer Multiple Readers (SWMR) Invariant</SPAN> states that if there are multiple copies of a cache block, they must be read-only because if copy is changed the other copies will be incorrect.

<P>
Previously we assumed that messages can be transmitted immediately on the bus. However, this is not true. The number of cores on CPUs or GPUs can be very high. For instance on the Intel Xeon Phi there are 72 x86 cores. For these types of processors, the buses would have to go between all cores and so the buses would have high capacitance and would be too slow. 

<P>
To get around this, we will use multi-cycle interconnects, such as a ring or mesh or torus. This means that the transmission of messages will take multiple cycles to move from one core to another core, and we have unpredictable latency. This prevents us from being able to listen on the bus. Instead we will send all messages to one place called a directory. This directory can be split physically but logically it is one entity. 

<P>
The directory will provide the similar functionality to the previously described bus. The directory will know all sharers who have a copy of a given block, and the state of each block. Usually the directory is attached to a piece of memory. 

<P>
It differs from the bus in that we must track each state explicitly. In the bus protocol each memory block in cache had a state, but here we also track the state of blocks in main memory.

You could also consider situation where multiple instructions perform an operation on a single piece of data. This is an uncommon architecture, but perhaps an example could be where one funtional unit performs an approximation very quickly, and another functional unit calculates the exact result but takes more time, then these values can be compared later. Video encoding could use an architecture like this.

After that you can consider multiple instructions performing operations on multiple  pieces of data in parallel. An example of this would be a multicore processor.

Finally, the architecture we will be talking about in this section, is that where a single instruction is performed using multiple pieces of data. Examples of this could be dot products or matrix multiplication. GPUs have this structure, whereby a whole bunch of threads are glued into one instruction. This is called the Single Instruction Multiple Data domain (SIMD). 

<P>
Let's back up and look at what we have covered so far. We have used out-of-order superscalar cores to run a sequence of instructions, and these use one thread of execution at a time. 

<P>
When we compile our code, we remove any parallelism that we may know ahead of time by creating just sequence of instructions. Any parallelism that we know ahead of time isn't told to the hardware. We have just used very clever tricks like register renaming, reservation stations, and the reorder buffer to extract as much parallelism as possible during execution. An then we have dealt with control flows that limit how much parallelism we can do, and so implemented  speculative execution to squeeze some more performance out of these processors. 

<P>
But by doing this, we've ended up devoting most of our hardware and most of our transistors to managing the execution, not actually performing computations. The amount of area on the processor that makes up the ALUs is minute in comparison. And this just seems inefficient, so let's look at some alternative  solutions.

At compile time, we can see that these  <TT>N</TT> computations  can be performed in parallel. However the compiler may incorrectly turn this into a sequence, or worst-still make us evaluate the branch every time. 

<P>
So instead of this we're going to write in our code specifying where the independent operations are so the processor isn't trying to figure it out on the fly. To do this, we'll make one large instruction with a bunch of operations and tell the hardware that all the pieces of this big instruction can be executed in parallel, and it doesn't have to worry about the sequence or the dependencies.

We also have a large register file, our caches (L1, texture, constants, and shared memory - a scratchpad).  We also have the SIMT front end which allows us to fetch instructions for multiple warps, schedule which warp to run at a given time, and deal with branches.

First we decide what instruction to fetch, then get it from the instruction cache, then we decode the instruction. Once we decode it we can put it in the instruction buffer and the in-order scoreboard. Then we figure out what warp to issue, so we get the registers from the operand collector and then do the operating by accessing memory or the ALU. After this you can writeback to update the register file and the scoreboard.

Fetch and Decode</A>

<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">If you have a cache miss or a longer-latency operation, then skip it while its stalled and fetch other warps to cover the latency.

<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">We don't really care about completing out of order because as long as the frame completes we synchronize after we complete. We don't need an out-of-order scoreboard because in a GPU because we can cover latency by switching to execute other warps - we're not trying to cover latency by extracting parallelism from independent subsequent instructions. It also saves us using extra hardware.

Instruction Issue</A>

<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">Recent GPUs are superscalar - they can issue multiple warps per cycle.

<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">They also  have a replay mechanism to avoid stalling in the pipeline. What this means is that when an instruction is issued from the instruction buffer, it is kept there until the instruction is complete.

<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">Imagine a scenerio where there is a load-miss. We send the load to the execution unit, the execution unit accesses the memory. Instead of waiting for the load to return a value, the GPU will forgot about this instruction and issue something else then reissue this instruction later when the load has returned a value.

GPU Register Files</A>

<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">Recall that these are very big. MIPS64 has 32 64-bit registers, so a 256 byte register file. In comparison, the NVidia Pascal has 64 warps, each with 32 threads, each with 32 32-bit registers, so a 256 KB register file.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">We also must access four registers per instructions: one to write to, and three to read from (for multiply-and-add <SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>).

We also use some compressing to save bandwidth for pixels that have the same colours and we can just average.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">Also to improve throughput, memory accesses are coalesced. This means that from a single warp you will be accessing blocks on the same cache-line to reduce the number of accesses to the cache, similar in principle to an MSHR. 
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">Cache blocks are also about twice as large in GPUs as in CPUs. We can get away with this because there is very little temporal locality in GPUs. These caches also tend to be write-through or write-evict to prefer streaming cache accesses.

<SMALL CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE">We also have a scratchpad (caches keep copies of data, scratchpads aren't copies, they're the only data), a texture cache, and a constant cache. We also have an L2 cache, which is the last-level cache (LLC). On a CPU the LLC would more likely be a L3 or L4 cache.

you might make chips more cheaply if you placed an extra core on the die and only
threw out chips on which both processors had failed. We will solve this exercise by
viewing the yield as a probability of no defects occurring in a certain area given the
defect rate. Calculate probabilities based on each Opteron core separately (this may not
be entirely accurate, since the yield equation is based on empirical evidence rather than a
mathematical calculation relating the probabilities of finding errors in different portions
of the chip). The die size is 199<SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN> and estimated defect rate is .75/<SPAN CLASS="MATH"></SPAN>.
