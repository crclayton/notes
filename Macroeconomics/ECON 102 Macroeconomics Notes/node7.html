Unemployment, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">3#3</SPAN></A>
</H3>

<P>
To increase nation income, more must be produced, so either more workers must be employed or existing employees must become more productive. In the short run, changes in productivity are very small, so increasing production closely relates to increasing employment. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Unemployment</SPAN> refers to the number of adult workers who are not employed but who are actively searching for a job. If you've never thought about the word employment, take a moment to consider it. It shows that that person is a resource, and as a resource they are a resource being used, or employed by the economy. Similarly, unemployment means that there are resources not being used, namely people. 

<P>
There are different kinds of unemployment. 

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Frictional unemployment</SPAN> refers to constant turnover in the economy of working people. Some people quit to look for jobs elsewhere, some people are fired for showing up late, and some people just graduated and are still looking for a job. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Structural unemployment</SPAN> refers to when there is a mismatch between the available jobs and the available labour force. For instance, all the teaching jobs may be in Alberta, but all the teachers are in BC. Or maybe there is need for lots of millwrights, but there aren't enough millwrights available.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cyclical employment</SPAN> refers to routine unemployment that changes with the ups and downs of the business cycle or unemployment that changes seasonally. For instance, ski instructors don't work in the summer and treeplanters don't work in the winter. Most employment data actually adjusts for these trends, called seasonal adjustments.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
From an economic perspective, the reason unemployment is so important is because human labour is the least durable commodity. If the economy having a slow year so instead of logging 10k trees, only 5k trees are logged. Then you can still log those remaining 5k trees the following year. However, if there are 100 people who are unemployed one year, the value of the labour of 100 people is lost forever. In this way, unemployment is extremely wasteful.
