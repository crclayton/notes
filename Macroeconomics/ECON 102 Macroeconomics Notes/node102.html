Metallic Money</A>
</H3>

<P>
All sorts of things have been used as money, but metals like gold and silver were the most successful. They were easily recognizable, divisible, and did not wear out. Before the invention of coins, people had to carry it around in bulk and weigh it on scales. 

<P>
Coins eliminated this need by creating fixed units, however this needed an authority to guarantee the value. So monarchs would stamp the coin with their seal and the coin would then be accepted at "face value". This led to edge clipping and debasing coins by mixing in cheap metals like nickel. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Gresham's Law</SPAN> states that money that's been debased usually stays in circulation, whereas "good" money tends to hoarded.
