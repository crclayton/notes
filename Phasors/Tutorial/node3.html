Resistances, Reactances, and Impedances</A>
</H2>

<P>
So there are voltages and currents. We're two-thirds of the way there, we just have to talk about resistances now. But your DC circuits teacher lied to you, Ohms law isn't <SPAN CLASS="MATH">7#7</SPAN>, it's <!-- MATH
 $\vec{V}=\vec{I}\vec{Z}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">8#8</SPAN>. We're no longer just talking about resistances. When we incorporate capacitors and inductors in AC, we're talking about impedances. An <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">impedance, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">9#9</SPAN></SPAN> is also a vector. Though we typically don't treat it like a magnitude and an angle, as we do with voltages and currents. Instead, it's broken up into its components. Once component, which we'll treat as the horizontal axis, is the resistance, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10#10</SPAN>. That's just the value from the resistor in the branch. The other component is <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">reactance, <SPAN CLASS="MATH">11#11</SPAN></SPAN>. 

<P>
For an inductor, the reactance is <!-- MATH
 $X_L = 2 \pi f L$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">12#12</SPAN>. For a capacitor the reactance is <!-- MATH
 $X_C = \frac{-1}{2\pi f C}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">13#13</SPAN>, which includes those frequencies I said we would ignore. 

<P>
There's one thing I've been putting off mentioning. So these values are vectors right, so one component is in the horizontal direction, usually called <SPAN CLASS="MATH">14#14</SPAN>, and one component is in the vertical direction, usually called <SPAN CLASS="MATH">15#15</SPAN>. But instead of writing our vectors as <!-- MATH
 $a \hat \imath + b \hat \jmath$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">16#16</SPAN>, we're going to imagine them as in the complex plain, so we'll treat them as complex numbers. The x-axis is the real component, the y-axis is the imaginary component. And because electrical engineers already decided to use <SPAN CLASS="MATH">17#17</SPAN> to represent current (which sidenote, stands for <SPAN  CLASS="textit">intensity</SPAN> of current), we will instead use <SPAN CLASS="MATH">18#18</SPAN> as the imaginary number. So our vector instead becomes  a complex number, <!-- MATH
 $a \hat \imath + b \hat \jmath \rightarrow a + jb$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">19#19</SPAN> 

<P>
All that to say the impedance vector is made up of the resistance in the branch as the real component, and the reactance of the branch as the imaginary component, <!-- MATH
 $\vec{Z} = R + j X$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">20#20</SPAN>

\vec{V} = \frac{V_{_{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}} \angle \phi \ \ \ \ \ \ \vec{I} = \frac{I_{_{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}} \angle \phi \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \vec{Z} = R + j X
