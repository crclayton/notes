Commercial Banks</A>
</H3>

<P>
Commercial banks are privately owned, profit-seeking institutions. They provide services like checks and debit cards to make easy transactions, they also provide convenient savings accounts to earn small but guaranteed interest, and financial advisement. 

<P>
With peoples' savings, they invest in government securities, make loans to households and firms, and divide loans into small pieces and repackage them into <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">securities</SPAN>. 

<P>
Credit is the lifeblood of the modern economy. For instance, wages for workers and production materials have to be paid well before the revenue for a new product is earned. Firms have to fund their capital investments with the borrowed money, and when firms have no access to credit, many businesses would grind to a halt. 

<P>
The main <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">asset</SPAN> of commercial banks is stakes in securities and loans. Their main <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">liability</SPAN> are their deposits, which they will have to repay on request. They therefore keep a percentage of money in the bank that they do not lend out, called a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">reserve-ratio</SPAN>.
